# Interactive-world-map
Interactive world map using computer vision.  
First we setup up a webcam so it points to the map or we can also use a phone as webcam with some of the webcam apps.  
I used Iriun webcam app with an Iphone in this case.  
When poistion the camera on the world map than run the get_map.py file to extract a wrap the image.
